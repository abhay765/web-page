<h1 style="color:purple;"> Air Pollution </h1>
<p> Air pollution can be defined as an alteration of air quality that can be characterized by measurements of chemical, biological or physical pollutants in the air. 
<br>Therefore, air pollution means the undesirable presence of impurities or the abnormal rise in the proportion of some constituents of the atmosphere. 
<br>It can be classified in 2 sections: visible and invisible air pollution.

<h1 style="color:green;">Air pollution causes</h1>
<p>  
Air pollution is caused by the presence in the atmosphere of toxic substances,
 mainly produced by human activities, 
<br>even though sometimes it can result from natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, 
<br> dust storms and wildfires, also depleting the air quality.
<br> Anthropogenic air pollution sources are:
<br><b>1.
Combustion of fossil fuels, like coal and oil for electricity and road transport, producing air pollutants like nitrogen and sulfur dioxide.</b>
<br><b>2.
Emissions from industries and factories, releasing large amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, chemicals and organic compounds into the air.</b>
<br><b>3.
Agricultural activities, due to the use of pesticides, insecticides, and fertilizers that emit harmful chemicals.</b>
<br><b>4.
Waste production, mostly because of methane generation in landfills.</b>
